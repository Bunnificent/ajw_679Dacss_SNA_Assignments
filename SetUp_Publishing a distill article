Publishing an article via distill 

• First, make sure you have the distill package installed. 

• To install the package, run 
                               install.packages("distill") 
  in your RStudio console. 

• Next, create an R Markdown file that will output a distill article in html format. 
  – To do so, you can run 
                           distill::create_article("<insert your new file name>") 
    in your RStudio console. 
  – OR, you can click File-> New File-> R Markdown-> From Template-> Distill Article-> OK 

• Make sure your Rmd file includes the following: 
  – Include a brief description in the YAML description field. This can be anything, but it should be in quotes and should describe the general content of your article. 
  – Also, make sure to change your setup chunk to 
                        knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
    This step is crucial, as it ensures your code will print in the knitted file. 

• Then, follow the regular steps to complete the RMarkdown file, publish the post to RPubs, and then submit it to the course blog.
